# 🏡House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts residential house prices by applying structured data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling on real-world housing data.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To build a robust regression pipeline that learns pricing patterns from historical housing data and accurately predicts house prices for unseen properties.  
This project demonstrates practical, industry-aligned data science skills.
